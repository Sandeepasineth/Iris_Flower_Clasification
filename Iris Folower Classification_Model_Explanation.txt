### Voiceover for Each Code Section

#### 1. Importing Libraries
**Code:**
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
```

**Explanation:**  
"To begin, I import the necessary libraries. NumPy is used for numerical operations, and scikit-learn provides tools to load the Iris dataset, split the data, train the model, and evaluate it. I specifically use the Random Forest Classifier for our model and metrics like accuracy and a classification report to assess performance."

---

#### 2. Loading the Dataset
**Code:**
```python
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data  # Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
y = iris.target  # Target: species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
```

**Explanation:**  
"Next, I load the Iris dataset. It comes preloaded in scikit-learn, and I split it into features, stored in `X`, and target labels, stored in `y`. The features include sepal and petal measurements, while the target specifies the flower species."

---

#### 3. Splitting the Dataset
**Code:**
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

**Explanation:**  
"Here, I divide the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set evaluates how well the model generalizes to new data. I set a random state for consistent results."

---

#### 4. Creating and Training the Model
**Code:**
```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Explanation:**  
"Now, I create our machine learning model using a Random Forest Classifier. This algorithm builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions for improved accuracy. I use 100 decision trees and train the model using the `fit` method on the training data."

---

#### 5. Making Predictions
**Code:**
```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

**Explanation:**  
"Once the model is trained, I use it to predict the species of flowers in the test dataset. The `predict` method generates predictions based on the features in the test set."

---

#### 6. Evaluating the Model
**Code:**
```python
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

**Explanation:**  
"To evaluate the model, I calculate its accuracy by comparing the predicted labels to the actual labels in the test set. Also print a classification report that shows precision, recall, and F1-score for each flower species, providing a detailed performance overview."

---

#### 7. Example Prediction
**Code:**
```python
example = np.array([[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]])  # Example input: Sepal and petal measurements
predicted_class = model.predict(example)
print(f"\nPredicted class for {example}: {iris.target_names[predicted_class[0]]}")
```

**Explanation:**  
"Finally, I test the model with an example input: a flower with a sepal length of 5.1, sepal width of 3.5, petal length of 1.4, and petal width of 0.2. The model predicts the species as Setosa, which aligns with the given measurements."

---

#### 8. Optional: Visualizing the Confusion Matrix
**Code:**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay

ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(model, X_test, y_test, display_labels=iris.target_names, cmap=plt.cm.Blues)
plt.title("Confusion Matrix")
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**  
"As an optional step, I visualize the model's performance using a confusion matrix. This matrix shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each flower species. It’s a great way to identify any areas where the model may struggle."

---

### Closing 
"And that’s how I built a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers using Python. I covered everything from loading the dataset to training the model, making predictions, and evaluating its performance. I hope this inspires you to create your own machine learning projects!"
